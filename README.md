# Calculus Handout Project

A single-sided A4 **calculus handout** for high-school students self-studying toward college calculus, paired with companion teaching videos. The handout is self-sufficient; the video is reinforcement.

This file is the **repository hub**. It is authoritative for repo layout, preamble structure, and build instructions. Content-authoring rules and media-pipeline rules live in their own files, linked below.

---

## Start here

Pick the task you have, open the linked file.

- **Writing or revising a chapter.** Start with [`CONTENT_QUICKSTART.md`](CONTENT_QUICKSTART.md). Fall back to [`CONTENT_SPEC.md`](CONTENT_SPEC.md) when the quickstart does not answer your question. Check [`CONTENT_ROADMAP.md`](CONTENT_ROADMAP.md) before starting a new chapter.
- **Producing a video** (primary path — Manim animations). Start with [`MANIM_CHECKLIST.md`](MANIM_CHECKLIST.md) for step-by-step, then [`MANIM_STORYBOARD.md`](MANIM_STORYBOARD.md) for how to translate a finalised section into a YAML storyboard, and [`MANIM_REFERENCE.md`](MANIM_REFERENCE.md) for templates, field contracts, and render commands.
- **Static-slide MP4** (frozen legacy path). Use [`LEGACY_SLIDE_PIPELINE.md`](LEGACY_SLIDE_PIPELINE.md). No new development on this path — use Manim for new work.
- **Designing end-of-section exercises.** [`CONTENT_EXERCISES.md`](CONTENT_EXERCISES.md) (minimum skeleton until the full design round opens).

## Authoring workflow

Chapters originate as **manuscripts written by different teachers** who have split the book between them. Claude interacts with those manuscripts in two distinct modes, and the rules differ by mode. Get the mode right before acting.

### Mode A — Drafting (Claude converts a new manuscript to LaTeX)

Use this mode when the user forwards a manuscript and asks Claude to produce a chapter file. Claude's role:

1. Receive the manuscript from the user.
2. Convert it into project-compliant LaTeX at `chapters/chNN_<slug>.tex`, following [`CONTENT_SPEC.md`](CONTENT_SPEC.md) and [`CONTENT_QUICKSTART.md`](CONTENT_QUICKSTART.md).
3. Expand around the manuscript where completeness or the Stewart / Rogawski self-study register benefits from it. The expansion policy below describes what kinds of additions are in-policy and how they must be marked.
4. Update [`CONTENT_ROADMAP.md`](CONTENT_ROADMAP.md) to reflect what the manuscript actually decided, replacing any pre-manuscript working-hypothesis entries.

#### The manuscript is the main axis

Every manuscript topic, example, remark, proof, and figure idea appears in the chapter in the order the manuscript presents them, rewritten into project-compliant LaTeX. Claude does **not** skip manuscript content, does **not** reorder it without reason, and does **not** rewrite its mathematical substance. Expansions wrap around manuscript content; they never replace it.

If a reorder or structural regroup is genuinely useful, record it in the chapter's roadmap entry under *Open questions* so the user can sign off during review.

#### Expansion policy — liberal in scope, visible by marker

Claude may expand around the manuscript without pre-authorisation, on the condition that **every expansion is marked** in the LaTeX source so post-hoc review is tractable. The marker takes the form

```latex
% expansion:<category> — <one-line description>
```

placed on the line immediately preceding the expansion content. Optional source hint: append `[source: <brief source>]` after the description for expansions based on a specific reference.

Recognised categories (the `book_style_lint` check enforces this list):

| Category | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `history` | math-history context: how the concept was developed, why the notation was chosen |
| `application` | real-world connection: physics, economics, geometry, engineering tie-in |
| `formula` | derived identity / corollary that follows from what the manuscript proved or defined |
| `summary` | synthesis paragraph tying a block of examples or a proof back together |
| `figure` | figure idea the manuscript implies via prose but does not draw |
| `example` | supplementary `workedexample` illustrating a technique the manuscript introduced |
| `intuition` | motivation paragraph before a formal statement, or an *Informally, ...* gloss |
| `strategy` | `strategy` box distilling a method shared by multiple manuscript examples |
| `caution` | `caution` box for subtle restrictions, notation traps, or common errors |

The category list is intentionally small; when a durable new type appears, grow this table in the same commit that introduces the first marker of the new category, and the lint will accept it going forward.

Post-hoc review then becomes

```powershell
grep "^% expansion:" chapters/chNN_*.tex
```

— the user sees every non-manuscript addition at a glance and decides *keep*, *rewrite*, or *remove* per marker, without having to diff the full chapter against the manuscript.

#### Named-content guardrail (the hard rule that survives liberal expansion)

Even with a liberal expansion policy, **named content** stays gated:

- specific historical figures by name;
- specific dates, centuries, or quotations;
- proper-name attributions of theorems, methods, or ideas;
- named results or conjectures not introduced in the manuscript or an earlier chapter.

These are the highest-risk class for hallucination because a wrong attribution or a misdated note is invisible to a casual reader and expensive to correct after print. Claude **does not include** named content unless:

- (a) the manuscript introduces it, or
- (b) an earlier committed chapter establishes it, or
- (c) the user explicitly authorises the specific name / date / attribution, or
- (d) the expansion marker cites a verifiable source, e.g. `% expansion:history [source: Stewart, Calculus 8e, §1.3 historical note] — brief context on the development of limits`, and the user understands that signing off on the marker during review endorses the cited source.

When the anchor is uncertain, default to **vague framing** instead of specific facts: *"early treatments of this problem by seventeenth-century mathematicians"* (no names, no specific year) rather than *"Fermat's 1637 method of adequality"* (three named facts, each a potential hallucination). Vague framing is in-policy; named-but-unsourced framing is not.

#### Volumetric sanity check (soft, not enforced)

Expansions should amplify the manuscript, not overwhelm it. Rough calibration:

- a 3-line definition typically gets at most a 3-line *Informally* gloss, one short `caution`, and at most one short `remark` — not all of them stacked;
- a section where `% expansion:` markers visibly outnumber manuscript-derived content is drifting; flag it in the chapter's roadmap *Open questions* so the ratio gets reviewed during sign-off;
- historical and application expansions should be shorter than the mathematical content they attach to.

No hard rule on ratios — just a self-check. If post-hoc review consistently flags over-expansion, Claude should tighten in subsequent chapters.

#### Still forbidden in drafting mode

- skipping manuscript content (the manuscript is the axis);
- rewriting the mathematical substance of a manuscript claim (method of proof, choice of variable, definition form);
- inventing exercises — exercise inventories come from the manuscript (see [`CONTENT_EXERCISES.md`](CONTENT_EXERCISES.md));
- unmarked expansions — every non-translation addition takes an `% expansion:` marker;
- named content that violates the Named-content guardrail above.

Supplying a proof the manuscript omitted is a borderline case: per [`CONTENT_SPEC.md`](CONTENT_SPEC.md) §5 proofs are optional and omission is the default. Claude **may** add a proof as an `expansion:formula` (for a short derivation) or `expansion:example` (for a worked case) when the proof is short, standard, and illustrative; multi-page proofs or proofs that require material the chapter has not introduced need explicit user authorisation.

### Mode B — Reviewing (Claude audits existing committed content)

Use this mode when Claude is asked to review or reconcile an existing `chapters/*.tex` file against its manuscript or against the current spec. **Committed content is authorised content.** The user has signed off on what landed in `main`; Claude must **not** treat pre-existing expansions beyond the manuscript as "hallucination" just because they are not verbatim in the manuscript — the user may have authored the expansion themselves during the original drafting pass.

What Claude may flag in review mode:

- **Spec compliance** — rule violations against [`CONTENT_SPEC.md`](CONTENT_SPEC.md): disallowed display helpers, `\textbf` / `\textit` in prose, ASCII quotes, manual cross-reference prefixes, `\newcommand` in chapter files, missing chapter opening structure, etc. These are definite defects; propose fixes.
- **Notation drift** from the manuscript — e.g., the manuscript uses `[x]` and the `.tex` silently uses `\lfloor x \rfloor`. Surface this as a question for the user, not as a hallucination. The user may have intentionally upgraded the notation, or may want to realign to the manuscript.
- **Mathematical correctness** — if a statement looks wrong, surface it as *"please verify X"*, not as *"I'm removing X because it's not in the manuscript."*
- **Missing content from the manuscript** — if the manuscript covers a topic the `.tex` skips, flag the gap so the user can decide whether the omission was intentional.
- **Structural decisions** — section splits, theorem names, and similar editorial choices. Surface as questions; do not change unilaterally.
- **Expansion markers** — for chapters drafted under the marker policy, walk every `% expansion:` marker in the file and assess each one for fit (does it belong here?), register (does it match Stewart / Rogawski tone?), accuracy (especially `history` and `application` markers), and ratio (does it oversaturate the surrounding manuscript content?). Review findings go to the user per marker, not as removal proposals.

What Claude must **not** do in review mode:

- treat content in the `.tex` that is absent from the manuscript as hallucination by default;
- silently remove or rewrite user-authored expansions on the grounds that they lack a manuscript anchor;
- propose deletion of historical notes, extra worked examples, or extra remarks without first asking whether they were user-authored expansion or drafting-mode hallucination.

The operative question in review mode is *"is this content correct and compliant?"* — not *"is this content in the manuscript?"* Only in drafting mode does the second question become load-bearing.

### When manuscript and spec disagree (both modes)

- **Formatting**: [`CONTENT_SPEC.md`](CONTENT_SPEC.md) wins. Rewrite the manuscript's phrasing to comply (e.g., `\textbf{...}` → `\emph{...}` in prose, ASCII quotes → TeX quotes, manual cross-reference prefixes → `\cref{}`). The mathematics is unchanged.
- **Mathematical content**: the manuscript wins. If the manuscript proves a theorem a particular way, preserve the method; if the manuscript defines a term in a specific form, preserve that form. Notational differences from §9 of the spec get reconciled to the house convention, with a `caution` note if the reconciliation is non-trivial.
- **Genuine conflicts** (manuscript insists on a rule the spec forbids for editorial reasons, not mathematical ones): ask the user. Record the decision in the chapter's roadmap entry under *Open questions*.

Per-chapter manuscript tracking — who wrote it, when it was received, conversion status, and any user-authored expansion notes — lives in each chapter's entry in [`CONTENT_ROADMAP.md`](CONTENT_ROADMAP.md) under **Manuscript source**.

## Golden path

```
  chapters/*.tex  ──▶  inputs/manim_storyboards/<deck_id>.yml
  (CONTENT_SPEC)      (MANIM_STORYBOARD + MANIM_REFERENCE)
                                   │
                                   ▼
                         preview → audio → render
                         (MANIM_CHECKLIST)
                                   │
                                   ▼
                       artifacts/video/<deck_id>_manim.mp4
```

Finalize the chapter content first. Hand-write the storyboard from the finalized LaTeX. Preview scenes one at a time. Render audio and final MP4 once scenes feel right.

## Repository Layout

- `main.tex` — LaTeX entry point for the book.
- `chapters/` — chapter source files.
  - `chapters/_chapter_template.tex` — starter skeleton for a new chapter.
  - `chapters/_scratch.tex` — optional local scratch chapter, gated by `\ifincludescratchchapter`.
- `preamble/` — shared LaTeX setup (see *Preamble Map* below).
- `preamble_smoketest.tex` — minimal regression document for preamble-only layout checks.
- `refs/` — bibliography data.
- `tools/` — media-generation scripts plus book-source utilities (`book_style_lint.py`, `book_preamble_smoketest.py`, and vendored helpers).
- `schemas/` — JSON schema files for generated deck data.
- `inputs/` — reusable raw inputs: voice recordings, section media plans, Manim storyboards.
- `artifacts/` — mostly generated slides, narration, audio, video. Tracked exceptions: `artifacts/scripts/*_final.md`, `artifacts/slides/*.tex`, and `artifacts/manim/*/narration.md`.
- `.github/workflows/` — CI checks.

---

## Preamble Map

`preamble/` is split by responsibility so layout and template behavior can be found quickly:

- `preamble/packages.tex` — package loading: Times text/math fonts (`newtxtext` + `newtxmath`), `microtype`, `amsmath` / `amsthm` / `mathtools`, `graphicx` / `tikz` / `pgfplots`, `float` / `flafter`, `needspace`, `enumitem`, page geometry (3.3 cm margins), headers, `hyperref` / `cleveref`, `mdframed` with `framemethod=TikZ` for `caution` / `strategy`, `xcolor`, and the house inverse-trig operators (`\arccsc`, `\arcsec`, `\arccot`).
- `preamble/colors.tex` — the three-role semantic palette (`colorprimary` blue, `colorcaution` red, `colorauxiliary` gray) driving figures and accent bars on `caution` / `strategy`.
- `preamble/layout.tex` — paragraph indentation and spacing, list spacing, global `\linespread{1.05}`, float placement, running headers and footers, `\Needspace` hooks, shared short-formula helpers (`aligneddisplay`, `conditiondisplay`, `\pairdisplay`), and `\newdisplayenv{name}{begin}{end}` for any new wrapper around `\[...\]` (installs the kernel `\@doendpe` hook via `\AfterEndEnvironment` to suppress stray indents after the environment).
- `preamble/theorem_setup.tex` — per-env chapter-scoped counters for `definition` / `theorem` / `proposition` / `corollary`; the `solution` environment; `caution` and `strategy` (left-colour-bar `\newmdtheoremenv`); page-flow protection hooks; and the `workedexample` semantic wrapper that reserves space for an `example` + `solution` pair as a single unit.
- `preamble/numbering.tex` — equation numbering by chapter.
- `preamble/bibliography.tex` — bibliography backend and source file.

---

## Output Format

Single-sided A4 PDF, meant to be printed one page per sheet and distributed as a handout rather than bound.

- `\documentclass[a4paper,12pt,oneside]{book}` — same margin rule on every page.
- `margin=3.3cm` symmetric; text block near the 66–72 characters-per-line comfort range for 12 pt Times.
- `\linespread{1.05}` — modest extra leading for math-dense prose without sparse pages.
- `\fancyhead[L]` / `\fancyhead[R]` / `\fancyfoot[R]` (not the twoside `[LE]`/`[RO]` pattern).
- `main.tex` wraps `\maketitle` in `\begingroup\hypersetup{pageanchor=false}...\endgroup` to avoid duplicate-destination warnings on the title page.
- `main.tex` keeps `\ifprintbibliography` and `\ifincludescratchchapter` toggles near the top so the bibliography and the scratch chapter stay opt-in.

If the project ever needs a bound-book edition later, minimum changes: switch to `\documentclass[a4paper,12pt,twoside,openright]{book}`, rework `\fancyhead`/`\fancyfoot` to use `[LE]`/`[RO]` pairs, and consider asymmetric `inner`/`outer` margins with a `bindingoffset`.

---

## Build and CI

Local build:

```powershell
latexmk -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error -file-line-error main.tex
```

Before committing a chapter, also run:

```powershell
python tools/book_style_lint.py
python tools/book_preamble_smoketest.py
python tools/book_docs_lint.py
```

All four checks (the three above plus the `latexmk` build) run on every push and PR via [`.github/workflows/latex-checks.yml`](.github/workflows/latex-checks.yml). `book_docs_lint.py` scans markdown for stale `tools/<name>.py` command references and broken relative links, so doc-rename drift cannot slip through review unnoticed.

Authority: when repository layout or preamble decisions change, **this file** is authoritative; when writing or typesetting rules change, [`CONTENT_SPEC.md`](CONTENT_SPEC.md) is authoritative.

---

## Media scope note

End-of-section `\subsection*{Exercises}` blocks are for the printed handout only. They are **not** included in slide decks, narration scripts, Manim storyboards, synthesized audio, or rendered video. When planning section media, ignore the exercise block of the source section and build from definitions, theorems, examples, and exposition prose.

---

## Notes

- Local caches, virtual environments, and vendored dependencies live in hidden repo folders such as `.cache/`, `.venv/`, `.deps/`, and `.deps_f5/`.
- The checked-in media exemplar is Section 1.1 *Inverse Functions* (`ch01_inverse_functions`). The Manim storyboard lives at [`inputs/manim_storyboards/ch01_inverse_functions.yml`](inputs/manim_storyboards/ch01_inverse_functions.yml); the frozen slide plan lives at [`inputs/media_plans/ch01_inverse_functions.json`](inputs/media_plans/ch01_inverse_functions.json).

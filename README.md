# Calculus Handout Project

A single-sided A4 **calculus handout** for high-school students self-studying toward college calculus, paired with companion teaching videos. The handout is self-sufficient; the video is reinforcement.

This file is the **repository hub**. It is authoritative for repo layout, preamble structure, and build instructions. Content-authoring rules and media-pipeline rules live in their own files, linked below.

---

## Start here

Pick the task you have, open the linked file.

- **Writing or revising a chapter.** Start with [`CONTENT_QUICKSTART.md`](CONTENT_QUICKSTART.md). Fall back to [`CONTENT_SPEC.md`](CONTENT_SPEC.md) when the quickstart does not answer your question. Check [`CONTENT_ROADMAP.md`](CONTENT_ROADMAP.md) before starting a new chapter.
- **Producing a video** (primary path — Manim animations). Start with [`MANIM_CHECKLIST.md`](MANIM_CHECKLIST.md) for step-by-step, then [`MANIM_STORYBOARD.md`](MANIM_STORYBOARD.md) for how to translate a finalised section into a YAML storyboard, and [`MANIM_REFERENCE.md`](MANIM_REFERENCE.md) for templates, field contracts, and render commands.
- **Static-slide MP4** (frozen legacy path). Use [`LEGACY_SLIDE_PIPELINE.md`](LEGACY_SLIDE_PIPELINE.md). No new development on this path — use Manim for new work.
- **Designing end-of-section exercises.** [`CONTENT_EXERCISES.md`](CONTENT_EXERCISES.md) (minimum skeleton until the full design round opens).

## Authoring workflow

Chapters originate as **manuscripts written by different teachers** who have split the book between them. Claude interacts with those manuscripts in two distinct modes, and the rules differ by mode. Get the mode right before acting.

### Mode A — Drafting (Claude converts a new manuscript to LaTeX)

Use this mode when the user forwards a manuscript and asks Claude to produce a chapter file. Claude's role:

1. Receive the manuscript from the user.
2. Convert it into project-compliant LaTeX at `chapters/chNN_<slug>.tex`, following [`CONTENT_SPEC.md`](CONTENT_SPEC.md) and [`CONTENT_QUICKSTART.md`](CONTENT_QUICKSTART.md).
3. Expand *around* the manuscript where completeness or the Stewart / Rogawski self-study register demands additions: *"Informally, ..."* glosses inside `definition`, intuition paragraphs before formal statements, `strategy` boxes distilling a method that the manuscript's examples share, `caution` boxes for subtle restrictions, `remark` additions with a clear usefulness hook, and figure ideas the manuscript implies but does not draw. These additions are **additive, not substitutive**: they surround the manuscript, they do not replace it.
4. Update [`CONTENT_ROADMAP.md`](CONTENT_ROADMAP.md) to reflect what the manuscript actually decided, replacing any pre-manuscript working-hypothesis entries.

In this mode, the **hard rule: no fabricated content** applies in full.

Every mathematical claim, definition, theorem, example, proof, figure, historical note, date, and proper name Claude writes into a chapter in this mode **MUST** trace to one of:

- (a) the teacher's manuscript itself;
- (b) an earlier chapter of this book (already committed to `chapters/*.tex`);
- (c) a widely-verifiable standard calculus result the user can sanity-check against a named source.

When a fact does not have a clear anchor in (a), (b), or (c), **do not invent one**. Leave the material out and mark the gap with a comment in the LaTeX source:

```latex
% TODO: manuscript silent on <topic>; user to decide whether to add and from which source.
```

Asking one clarifying question is always cheaper than shipping a fabricated fact. A handout with a wrong theorem attribution, a misdated historical note, or an invented "canonical example" is worse than one that omits the material entirely, because students cannot know which claims to verify independently.

Specifically forbidden **in drafting mode**, without explicit user authorisation:

- inventing worked examples the manuscript does not contain;
- attributing theorems to mathematicians the manuscript did not name;
- supplying historical dates or quotations the manuscript did not give;
- inventing exercises (exercise inventories come from the manuscript; see [`CONTENT_EXERCISES.md`](CONTENT_EXERCISES.md));
- supplying a proof the manuscript omitted — per [`CONTENT_SPEC.md`](CONTENT_SPEC.md) §5, proofs are optional; omission is the default.

If the user gives explicit authorisation for a specific expansion (*"please add a caution about the sin⁻¹ vs 1/sin confusion"*, *"add a worked example showing the three-step inverse procedure on a cubic"*), the authorised expansion is in-policy; record it in the chapter's roadmap **Open questions** or **Manuscript source** note so the audit trail survives.

### Mode B — Reviewing (Claude audits existing committed content)

Use this mode when Claude is asked to review or reconcile an existing `chapters/*.tex` file against its manuscript or against the current spec. **Committed content is authorised content.** The user has signed off on what landed in `main`; Claude must **not** treat pre-existing expansions beyond the manuscript as "hallucination" just because they are not verbatim in the manuscript — the user may have authored the expansion themselves during the original drafting pass.

What Claude may flag in review mode:

- **Spec compliance** — rule violations against [`CONTENT_SPEC.md`](CONTENT_SPEC.md): disallowed display helpers, `\textbf` / `\textit` in prose, ASCII quotes, manual cross-reference prefixes, `\newcommand` in chapter files, missing chapter opening structure, etc. These are definite defects; propose fixes.
- **Notation drift** from the manuscript — e.g., the manuscript uses `[x]` and the `.tex` silently uses `\lfloor x \rfloor`. Surface this as a question for the user, not as a hallucination. The user may have intentionally upgraded the notation, or may want to realign to the manuscript.
- **Mathematical correctness** — if a statement looks wrong, surface it as *"please verify X"*, not as *"I'm removing X because it's not in the manuscript."*
- **Missing content from the manuscript** — if the manuscript covers a topic the `.tex` skips, flag the gap so the user can decide whether the omission was intentional.
- **Structural decisions** — section splits, theorem names, and similar editorial choices. Surface as questions; do not change unilaterally.

What Claude must **not** do in review mode:

- treat content in the `.tex` that is absent from the manuscript as hallucination by default;
- silently remove or rewrite user-authored expansions on the grounds that they lack a manuscript anchor;
- propose deletion of historical notes, extra worked examples, or extra remarks without first asking whether they were user-authored expansion or drafting-mode hallucination.

The operative question in review mode is *"is this content correct and compliant?"* — not *"is this content in the manuscript?"* Only in drafting mode does the second question become load-bearing.

### When manuscript and spec disagree (both modes)

- **Formatting**: [`CONTENT_SPEC.md`](CONTENT_SPEC.md) wins. Rewrite the manuscript's phrasing to comply (e.g., `\textbf{...}` → `\emph{...}` in prose, ASCII quotes → TeX quotes, manual cross-reference prefixes → `\cref{}`). The mathematics is unchanged.
- **Mathematical content**: the manuscript wins. If the manuscript proves a theorem a particular way, preserve the method; if the manuscript defines a term in a specific form, preserve that form. Notational differences from §9 of the spec get reconciled to the house convention, with a `caution` note if the reconciliation is non-trivial.
- **Genuine conflicts** (manuscript insists on a rule the spec forbids for editorial reasons, not mathematical ones): ask the user. Record the decision in the chapter's roadmap entry under *Open questions*.

Per-chapter manuscript tracking — who wrote it, when it was received, conversion status, and any user-authored expansion notes — lives in each chapter's entry in [`CONTENT_ROADMAP.md`](CONTENT_ROADMAP.md) under **Manuscript source**.

## Golden path

```
  chapters/*.tex  ──▶  inputs/manim_storyboards/<deck_id>.yml
  (CONTENT_SPEC)      (MANIM_STORYBOARD + MANIM_REFERENCE)
                                   │
                                   ▼
                         preview → audio → render
                         (MANIM_CHECKLIST)
                                   │
                                   ▼
                       artifacts/video/<deck_id>_manim.mp4
```

Finalize the chapter content first. Hand-write the storyboard from the finalized LaTeX. Preview scenes one at a time. Render audio and final MP4 once scenes feel right.

## Repository Layout

- `main.tex` — LaTeX entry point for the book.
- `chapters/` — chapter source files.
  - `chapters/_chapter_template.tex` — starter skeleton for a new chapter.
  - `chapters/_scratch.tex` — optional local scratch chapter, gated by `\ifincludescratchchapter`.
- `preamble/` — shared LaTeX setup (see *Preamble Map* below).
- `preamble_smoketest.tex` — minimal regression document for preamble-only layout checks.
- `refs/` — bibliography data.
- `tools/` — media-generation scripts plus book-source utilities (`book_style_lint.py`, `book_preamble_smoketest.py`, and vendored helpers).
- `schemas/` — JSON schema files for generated deck data.
- `inputs/` — reusable raw inputs: voice recordings, section media plans, Manim storyboards.
- `artifacts/` — mostly generated slides, narration, audio, video. Tracked exceptions: `artifacts/scripts/*_final.md`, `artifacts/slides/*.tex`, and `artifacts/manim/*/narration.md`.
- `.github/workflows/` — CI checks.

---

## Preamble Map

`preamble/` is split by responsibility so layout and template behavior can be found quickly:

- `preamble/packages.tex` — package loading: Times text/math fonts (`newtxtext` + `newtxmath`), `microtype`, `amsmath` / `amsthm` / `mathtools`, `graphicx` / `tikz` / `pgfplots`, `float` / `flafter`, `needspace`, `enumitem`, page geometry (3.3 cm margins), headers, `hyperref` / `cleveref`, `mdframed` with `framemethod=TikZ` for `caution` / `strategy`, `xcolor`, and the house inverse-trig operators (`\arccsc`, `\arcsec`, `\arccot`).
- `preamble/colors.tex` — the three-role semantic palette (`colorprimary` blue, `colorcaution` red, `colorauxiliary` gray) driving figures and accent bars on `caution` / `strategy`.
- `preamble/layout.tex` — paragraph indentation and spacing, list spacing, global `\linespread{1.05}`, float placement, running headers and footers, `\Needspace` hooks, shared short-formula helpers (`aligneddisplay`, `conditiondisplay`, `\pairdisplay`), and `\newdisplayenv{name}{begin}{end}` for any new wrapper around `\[...\]` (installs the kernel `\@doendpe` hook via `\AfterEndEnvironment` to suppress stray indents after the environment).
- `preamble/theorem_setup.tex` — per-env chapter-scoped counters for `definition` / `theorem` / `proposition` / `corollary`; the `solution` environment; `caution` and `strategy` (left-colour-bar `\newmdtheoremenv`); page-flow protection hooks; and the `workedexample` semantic wrapper that reserves space for an `example` + `solution` pair as a single unit.
- `preamble/numbering.tex` — equation numbering by chapter.
- `preamble/bibliography.tex` — bibliography backend and source file.

---

## Output Format

Single-sided A4 PDF, meant to be printed one page per sheet and distributed as a handout rather than bound.

- `\documentclass[a4paper,12pt,oneside]{book}` — same margin rule on every page.
- `margin=3.3cm` symmetric; text block near the 66–72 characters-per-line comfort range for 12 pt Times.
- `\linespread{1.05}` — modest extra leading for math-dense prose without sparse pages.
- `\fancyhead[L]` / `\fancyhead[R]` / `\fancyfoot[R]` (not the twoside `[LE]`/`[RO]` pattern).
- `main.tex` wraps `\maketitle` in `\begingroup\hypersetup{pageanchor=false}...\endgroup` to avoid duplicate-destination warnings on the title page.
- `main.tex` keeps `\ifprintbibliography` and `\ifincludescratchchapter` toggles near the top so the bibliography and the scratch chapter stay opt-in.

If the project ever needs a bound-book edition later, minimum changes: switch to `\documentclass[a4paper,12pt,twoside,openright]{book}`, rework `\fancyhead`/`\fancyfoot` to use `[LE]`/`[RO]` pairs, and consider asymmetric `inner`/`outer` margins with a `bindingoffset`.

---

## Build and CI

Local build:

```powershell
latexmk -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error -file-line-error main.tex
```

Before committing a chapter, also run:

```powershell
python tools/book_style_lint.py
python tools/book_preamble_smoketest.py
python tools/book_docs_lint.py
```

All four checks (the three above plus the `latexmk` build) run on every push and PR via [`.github/workflows/latex-checks.yml`](.github/workflows/latex-checks.yml). `book_docs_lint.py` scans markdown for stale `tools/<name>.py` command references and broken relative links, so doc-rename drift cannot slip through review unnoticed.

Authority: when repository layout or preamble decisions change, **this file** is authoritative; when writing or typesetting rules change, [`CONTENT_SPEC.md`](CONTENT_SPEC.md) is authoritative.

---

## Media scope note

End-of-section `\subsection*{Exercises}` blocks are for the printed handout only. They are **not** included in slide decks, narration scripts, Manim storyboards, synthesized audio, or rendered video. When planning section media, ignore the exercise block of the source section and build from definitions, theorems, examples, and exposition prose.

---

## Notes

- Local caches, virtual environments, and vendored dependencies live in hidden repo folders such as `.cache/`, `.venv/`, `.deps/`, and `.deps_f5/`.
- The checked-in media exemplar is Section 1.1 *Inverse Functions* (`ch01_inverse_functions`). The Manim storyboard lives at [`inputs/manim_storyboards/ch01_inverse_functions.yml`](inputs/manim_storyboards/ch01_inverse_functions.yml); the frozen slide plan lives at [`inputs/media_plans/ch01_inverse_functions.json`](inputs/media_plans/ch01_inverse_functions.json).

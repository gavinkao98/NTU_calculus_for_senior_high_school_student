# Author Quickstart

This is the short daily-reference companion to [`CONTENT_SPEC.md`](CONTENT_SPEC.md). Use it while you are writing; go to the spec only when the quickstart does not answer your question or when you are about to deviate from a rule.

If you are new to the project, also skim [`CONTENT_ROADMAP.md`](CONTENT_ROADMAP.md) once to understand where your chapter sits in the arc.

## Register in one line

Stewart / Rogawski tone: accessible to a motivated high-schooler self-studying, full sentences with explicit connectives, intuition before formalism, warm without being chatty. Not Spivak, not lecture shorthand.

- default pronoun: **we**. Reserve **you** for gentle reminders or forward-reference (*"you will see this again in §4.2"*).
- every formal statement (`definition`, `theorem`, `proposition`, `corollary`) **SHOULD** be **preceded** by 1-2 paragraphs of intuition prose explaining why the concept is worth introducing and what it should mean.
- a `definition` body **MAY** additionally end with one vernacular gloss sentence of the form *"Informally, ..."*. This is a definition-specific option, not a blanket requirement on every formal environment. The gloss **MUST NOT** introduce examples, figures, or new notation.

## Environment cheat sheet

Pick the environment that matches the semantic role. Do not nest formal environments.

| Env | Use for |
|---|---|
| `definition` | introduces a term the chapter will use. Include `\index{...}` at first occurrence. |
| `theorem` | headline result of the section. `\begin{theorem}[Name]` + matching `\index{Name}`. |
| `proposition` | useful, reusable, but not the section's headline. |
| `corollary` | pedagogically worth calling out immediate consequence. |
| `example` + `solution` | always paired, always wrapped in `workedexample`. No solo `example`. |
| `workedexample` | semantic wrapper around exactly one `example`+`solution`. Not a page-break trick. |
| `proof` | genuine proof. Not for worked calculations. Optional (see spec §5). |
| `remark` | aside, notation note, short historical note, forward reference. **Not** main-line knowledge. |
| `caution` | notation trap or easy-to-miss restriction, 1-3 sentences. Left red accent. |
| `strategy` | method box with numbered steps ("given a problem of type X, do..."). |
| `exercise` | lives in `\subsection*{Exercises}`. See [`CONTENT_EXERCISES.md`](CONTENT_EXERCISES.md). |

Pedagogical targets per section (not quotas): **2-3 remarks**, **≥1 strategy** when worked examples share a method. Zero natural remarks is fine; padding to hit the number is not.

**Remark usefulness test.** Before you keep a `remark`, ask: *would a reader lose something if it were removed?* If the honest answer is "nothing, it just padded the section," drop it. Main-line facts, definition restatements, illustrative examples, and trivial tautologies are **not** remarks — promote them to prose, put them inside the `definition` as *"Informally, ..."*, wrap them in `workedexample`, or connect them with one sentence of prose instead. See SPEC §5 for good-vs-bad examples.

## Chapter opening (MUST)

```latex
\chapter{Title In Title Case}

Overview paragraph (1-2 paragraphs). Establish the chapter's
motivation and how it connects to the previous chapter.

\paragraph{By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item skill 1 (verb-first: "compute", "verify", "recognize");
  \item skill 2;
  \item skill 3-5.
\end{itemize}

\section{First Section Title}
...
```

Chapter end **MUST** have `\section*{Summary}` with definitions / theorems / formulas blocks. See spec §4.

---

## Section opening

1-2 paragraphs of motivation. A purely computational section may open with a single connecting sentence. Do not open a section with a definition or display math.

---

## Formula display: 5 modes

| Mode | When |
|---|---|
| inline `\(...\)` | short formula that belongs to the sentence. |
| display `\[...\]` | visually central formula or multi-step calculation. |
| `aligneddisplay` | short top-to-bottom peers or derivation steps. |
| `conditiondisplay` | formula with trailing domain / range / branch condition needing its own spacing. |
| `\pairdisplay{A}{B}` | exactly two short formulas compared left-to-right. Auto-stacks if too wide. |

Rules of thumb:
- one mode per local math unit. Do not mix centered, aligned, and prose-condition in the same step.
- `\qedhere` on the last display line of a `solution` that ends in display math.
- `\solutionbreak` at the start of a `solution` body that begins with a block (list or display math).
- **No** `\iff`-helper macros. For formal "A iff B", use display math with `\Longleftrightarrow`.

## Figure rule

- palette is three roles only: blue = primary, red = caution/counterexample, gray = auxiliary. See `preamble/colors.tex`.
- **do not encode meaning in colour alone.** Redundantly encode with at least one of: line style, label, marker. House line-style convention: solid = primary curves; `dashed` = asymptotes and reference lines (including `$y = x$`); `dotted` = auxiliary / scaffolding. Figures **must** survive grayscale print and photocopy. See SPEC §10 for the full redundant-encoding rule.
- default placement `[H]`. Declare an exception in a comment if you use `[htbp]`.
- captions: sentence case, end with a period, describe mathematical purpose.
- **worked-example figures** must not reveal the quantity the example asks the reader to compute.
- figure density target: one figure at each important definition / theorem, and roughly every 2-3 examples in computational sections.

---

## Index rule

`\index{...}` at **first occurrence** of:
- every defined term;
- every named theorem;
- every notation (e.g. `\arcsin`, `\lim_{x \to a}`);
- every key example the reader will want to flip back to;
- every applied setting (physics, economics) introduced in the chapter;
- every notation trap (also flagged by `caution`).

**Lookup test** (authoritative over the list above when they conflict): *will a reader want to find this item later without remembering which chapter introduced it?* If yes, index. Purely local symbols, one-off throwaway setups, and incidental applied settings used once for flavour do **not** need an entry, even when they would nominally fit one of the categories above.

---

## Cross-references and labels

- always `\cref{...}` / `\Cref{...}`. Never manual prefix like `Theorem~\ref{...}`.
- `\eqref{...}` for equation references.
- label format: `type:short-desc`, hyphens only. Examples: `def:one-to-one`, `thm:ivt`, `eq:limit-law-sum`, `fig:inverse-reflection`.
- equation numbers only on equations that will be referenced later or are formal statements.

---

## Prose typography

- emphasis: `\emph{...}` only, and only for first mention of a new term or a rare load-bearing phrase. **No** `\textbf{...}` or `\textit{...}` in prose (style lint enforces this).
- quotes: TeX style `` ``...'' ``. **No** ASCII `"..."` (style lint enforces).
- dashes: `--` for numeric range (*pp. 12--18*), `---` for aside dashes. No unicode em-dash in source.
- ellipses: always `\dots` (context-aware). Do not hard-code `\ldots` or three literal periods. LaTeX chooses `\cdots` automatically inside display operators.

---

## What chapter files **MUST NOT** contain

- `\newcommand`, `\renewcommand`, `\def`, `\newenvironment`, `\providecommand` (new helpers go in `preamble/`).
- `\newpage`, `\pagebreak`, `\clearpage` (pagination is handled globally).
- Manual cross-reference prefixes (*Figure~\ref{...}*).
- ASCII straight quotes.
- `\textbf` / `\textit` in prose.
- `\footnote`, `\marginpar`, or manual `\hypertarget` **inside** a `workedexample` body.

---

## Before committing

Run locally:

```powershell
python tools/book_style_lint.py
python tools/book_preamble_smoketest.py
python tools/book_docs_lint.py
latexmk -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode -halt-on-error -file-line-error main.tex
```

All four **MUST** pass. They also run on every push and PR via [`.github/workflows/latex-checks.yml`](.github/workflows/latex-checks.yml). `book_docs_lint` catches stale `tools/<name>.py` command examples and broken markdown links — it is cheap to run and will save review churn after renames.

For the full consistency checklist (positioning, register, structure, environments, typography, ...), see the checklist at the end of [`CONTENT_SPEC.md`](CONTENT_SPEC.md) §15.

## When to leave the quickstart

Go to the spec for:
- **§3** — full register guidance, style do/don't, voice-reference sample.
- **§5** — full environment policy, per-environment typical uses and rationale.
- **§6** — manual numbering edge cases, paired definitions at different precision levels.
- **§7** — full display decision tree, cohesion rules, delimiter sizing.
- **§9** — notation table.
- **§13** — exception protocol (how to document a rule deviation).

If a rule in the spec seems wrong after you have tried to write within it, do not silently deviate. File an exception comment (§13) and propose the rule change.

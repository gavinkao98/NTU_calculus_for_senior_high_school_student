# Manim Storyboard Authoring: LaTeX Handout to YAML

**Version 1.3** -- adds a SHOULD rule for `example_walkthrough` `data.decay_previous`: scenes whose voiceover calls back verbally to an earlier `math_line` or `step` should set it to `false` so the scene does not dim the line the narration is about to re-read. Also adds a matching pre-render checklist item. v1.2 (below) remains the current voiceover sentence-count rule.

**Version 1.1** -- adds a conformance legend (MUST / SHOULD / MAY), two worked before/after examples (LaTeX source -> YAML -> voiceover), softens the single-exemplar dependency on Sec. 1.1, aligns the "direct from LaTeX" workflow across `README.md`, `MANIM_REFERENCE.md`, and `MANIM_CHECKLIST.md`, and replaces non-ASCII punctuation (em-dash, en-dash, arrow) in body text so the file reads cleanly in terminal contexts.

Derived by reverse-engineering the Sec. 1.1 *Inverse Functions* storyboard ([`inputs/manim_storyboards/ch01_inverse_functions.yml`](inputs/manim_storyboards/ch01_inverse_functions.yml)) against the source section of [`chapters/ch01_foundations.tex`](chapters/ch01_foundations.tex). Sec. 1.1 is the current reference exemplar: it is the one worked-through section this guide is calibrated against. When the guide and Sec. 1.1 disagree, treat it as a signal to review both -- a chapter-specific preference in Sec. 1.1 should not silently become a general rule, and a general rule that produces a worse result in Sec. 1.1's context should not survive unchallenged. As more chapters are storyboarded, rules should converge on the common denominator across them, not on any single section.

This guide is the translation methodology layer. It is distinct from:

- [`MANIM_REFERENCE.md`](MANIM_REFERENCE.md) -- field reference, template catalog, rendering commands, visual design system.
- [`CONTENT_SPEC.md`](CONTENT_SPEC.md) -- textbook writing rules (authority over the `.tex` source).
- [`MANIM_CHECKLIST.md`](MANIM_CHECKLIST.md) -- operational steps for running the pipeline.

Read those for *what the machinery is* and *how to operate it*. Read this guide for *what to put in the YAML when staring at a chapter section*.

## Conformance Keywords

This document uses RFC 2119-style keywords to make load-bearing rules unambiguous:

- **MUST** / **MUST NOT** -- hard requirement. A storyboard that violates a MUST is out of compliance and SHOULD be fixed before rendering.
- **SHOULD** / **SHOULD NOT** -- strong recommendation. Deviation is acceptable only with a concrete reason; record the reason in a YAML comment near the deviating scene so a later editor can judge whether the deviation still applies.
- **MAY** -- optional. Use when it helps; the storyboard is equally valid without it.

Outside these keywords, words like *always added*, *encouraged*, *acceptable*, and *rare* describe current practice without carrying formal compliance weight. If a practice turns out to be load-bearing in review, it earns a MUST or SHOULD rewrite in a later revision.

---

## Purpose

A storyboard YAML is hand-written. It does **not** regenerate from the LaTeX handout. When `chapters/*.tex` changes, someone must re-read the section and revise the storyboard by hand.

This guide answers: *given a finalized section in the book, what storyboard do we write?*

The answer has several layers:

1. **Scope** -- what to include in the video, what to leave in the book.
2. **Decomposition** -- how to split a section into scenes.
3. **Mapping** -- how to pick a template for each scene.
4. **Voiceover rewriting** -- how to turn written prose into spoken narration.
5. **Figure handling** -- how to translate book figures into Manim.
6. **Pacing** -- how long scenes should run.

Each layer has rules below, grounded in the Sec. 1.1 exemplar.

---

## Overall Philosophy

The video is **a class**, not a book being read aloud. Three commitments follow:

1. **Detail over compression.** When in doubt, make a scene rather than merging content. The Sec. 1.1 storyboard has 16 scenes for ~300 lines of LaTeX -- roughly one scene per formal environment plus added visualizations. A 4-minute highlight reel is not the goal.
2. **Conversational over formal.** Narration is spoken English. Contractions stay light (prefer "let us" over "let's" for consistency with the classroom register), but the sentence rhythm is spoken, not printed. The book says "Determine which of these functions are one-to-one"; the video says "Now let us test two mathematical functions."
3. **Visual over textual.** When a concept can be shown on a graph, add a `graph_focus` scene even if the book only states it in prose. Reflections across `y = x`, counterexamples shown on a curve, and the horizontal line test all deserve their own visual scenes.

---

## Pre-flight: Inputs You Need

Before writing a line of YAML, have these open:

- The target section in `chapters/<chapter>.tex` -- read it start to end, including the chapter opening prose if this is the first section.
- [`MANIM_REFERENCE.md`](MANIM_REFERENCE.md) -- the **Templates (9)** table and the **Midnight Canvas** color semantics.
- An existing storyboard (start with Sec. 1.1) for cross-reference on style and field usage.
- The `schemas/manim_storyboard.schema.json` if you need the exact field contract.

Do **not** seed from the deck JSON. The modern workflow designs directly from LaTeX. Seeding is legacy.

---

## Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Read the source section** end to end. Identify every `\begin{definition}`, `\begin{theorem}`, `\begin{proposition}`, `\begin{remark}`, `\begin{example}`, `\begin{figure}`, and every subsection boundary. Note each one with its line number.
2. **Sketch a scene list** on paper or in a comment block -- one bullet per scene, in video order, before touching YAML. Decide per bullet: what template, what teaching idea.
3. **Drop in opening and closing scenes** -- an opening hook (`title_bullets`) and a recap (`recap_cards`). These are always added, never present in the book.
4. **Add transitions** between subsections if the section has enough structural breaks -- a `section_transition` scene is 3-4 seconds of relief between conceptual blocks.
5. **Add supplementary visualizations** where prose-only content in the book benefits from a graph (reflection across `y = x`, counterexamples on curves, domain restrictions). These are not in the book; they are added for pedagogy.
6. **Write each scene** -- `scene_id`, `template`, `content_type` if ambiguous, `title`, `voiceover`, `data`, `timing`. See per-field rules below.
7. **Preview every new `graph_focus` scene** with `tools/manim_preview_graph_focus.py` before committing -- this is faster than a full Manim render and catches most expression/labeling mistakes.
8. **Proofread the full narration** by exporting `narration.md` and reading it top to bottom as if you were a student. Edit in place, then `manim_sync_narration_back.py`.
9. **Render with audio** and watch the whole thing at 1x speed. Anything that sounds awkward or looks cramped is a signal to re-edit, not ship.

---

## Scene Decomposition

### Rule: one teaching idea per scene

A scene **MUST** hold exactly one thing a student should take away. If the voiceover needs two topic sentences, split the scene.

Concretely, each of the following is its own scene:

- one `\begin{definition}` environment
- one `\begin{theorem}` or `\begin{proposition}` statement
- one `\begin{proof}` (can combine with its theorem in a `theorem_proof` scene, or be its own scene after the statement)
- one `\begin{example}` + `\begin{solution}` pair
- one `\begin{remark}` **if** it rises to the level of a named rule (e.g., the horizontal line test); trivial remarks can be folded into nearby voiceover
- one book `\begin{figure}` that the video will redraw
- one standalone procedure / enumerated list (e.g., the 3-step "how to find an inverse")
- one added visualization that is not in the book

A storyboard **MUST NOT** cram a definition and its example into one scene, and **MUST NOT** merge two examples into one scene even if they are visually similar.

### Rule: added scenes are expected, not exceptional

The Sec. 1.1 storyboard has **six scenes with no direct source in the book**:

| Added scene | Why |
|---|---|
| `opening_hook` | Framing / motivation via title_bullets. Every video opens with one. |
| `why_x_squared_fails` | Turns a prose claim into a `graph_focus` visualization. |
| `transition_to_inverses` | `section_transition` between subsec 1.1.1 and 1.1.2. |
| `cubic_graph_reflection` | Reflection across `y = x` -- stated as prose in book, deserves a graph. |
| `restricted_parabola_graph` | Same -- domain restriction made visual. |
| `recap` | Closing `recap_cards`. Every video closes with one. |

A storyboard **MUST** include an opening-hook scene and a closing recap scene. A storyboard **SHOULD** include a `section_transition` scene between conceptual blocks when the source section has three or more subsections. A storyboard **SHOULD** add a supplementary `graph_focus` scene whenever the book makes a geometric claim (reflection, intersection, shape) in prose alone.

### Rule: scene count is not a budget

Do not try to keep the scene count low. Sec. 1.1 runs 16 scenes; a shorter or simpler section can be 8, a denser one can be 20. Count is an output of good decomposition, not a constraint on it.

---

## Environment -> Template Mapping

This is the single most common authoring decision. Use the following table as a first cut; the notes below handle the edge cases.

| Source environment | Default template | `content_type` | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `\begin{definition}` | `definition_math` | `definition` | The template is built around statement + math_lines. |
| `\begin{theorem}` with a `\begin{proof}` | `theorem_proof` | `theorem` | Statement + proof_steps in one scene. |
| `\begin{theorem}` without a proof | `definition_math` | `theorem` | Template handles this cleanly; content_type flags the gold accent. |
| `\begin{proposition}` | `definition_math` | `proposition` | Same as theorem-without-proof visually. |
| `\begin{lemma}` / `\begin{corollary}` | `definition_math` | `proposition` | Rare; treat as propositions visually. |
| `\begin{example}` + `\begin{solution}` | `example_walkthrough` | `example` | Each step becomes one `steps` entry, math_lines show the algebra. |
| `\begin{remark}` that names a rule (e.g., horizontal line test) | `definition_math` | `proposition` | Treat it as a lightweight proposition in the video. |
| `\begin{remark}` that is a short aside | (fold into voiceover of neighboring scene) | -- | A 2-sentence warning does not need its own scene. |
| Enumerated procedure / algorithm list | `procedure_steps` | `procedure` | Use `worked_equations` for the symbolic template of the procedure. |
| `\begin{figure}` with a function graph | `graph_focus` | inherit or `example` | Redraw in Manim axes + plots. |
| `\begin{figure}` with a conceptual diagram (mapping, interval, arrows) | `graph_focus` + custom `hook` | -- | Templates cannot draw arbitrary TikZ; write a hook. |
| Subsection boundary with a named transition | `section_transition` | -- | Optional; use it when it genuinely helps pacing. |
| (always add) Opening motivation | `title_bullets` | `definition` | Bullets preview the question the video will answer. |
| (always add) Closing summary | `recap_cards` | `recap` | 4-6 `points`, 1-2 canonical `identities`. |
| (add when useful) Reflection / geometric visualization stated in prose | `graph_focus` | `example` | Two curves + `y = x` dashed; see `cubic_graph_reflection`. |
| (add when useful) Side-by-side concept comparison | `comparison` | -- | Use only when contrast is the lesson. |

### Edge case: two formal statements close together

If a `\begin{definition}` is followed immediately by a short `\begin{proposition}` that is really just a domain/range restatement of the definition, it is acceptable to put the proposition in the `supporting_bullets` of the definition scene. But if the proposition gets its own label in the book and is referenced later, give it its own scene.

### Edge case: proof that is longer than its statement

If the proof has more than ~4 steps, split into a `definition_math` scene for the statement and a `theorem_proof` scene (with the statement repeated) for the proof. Students can then pause after the statement before watching the proof.

### Worked example: definition -> `definition_math` scene

This is the first formal statement in the source of Sec. 1.1. It illustrates the typical `definition` -> `definition_math` mapping, spoken-math rewriting, and the role of `animation: "highlight"`.

**LaTeX source** (`chapters/ch01_foundations.tex`, Sec. 1.1.1):

~~~latex
\begin{definition}
Let \(f\) be a function with domain \(A\). We say that \(f\) is \emph{one-to-one}\index{one-to-one function} if
\[
f(x_1)\ne f(x_2)
\qquad \text{whenever } x_1\ne x_2.
\]
Equivalently, \(f\) is one-to-one if
\[
f(x_1)=f(x_2) \implies x_1=x_2.
\]
\end{definition}
~~~

**Scene YAML** (from [`inputs/manim_storyboards/ch01_inverse_functions.yml`](inputs/manim_storyboards/ch01_inverse_functions.yml)):

~~~yaml
- scene_id: "one_to_one_definition"
  template: "definition_math"
  content_type: "definition"
  scene_exit: "hold"
  title: "One-to-One Functions"
  voiceover: >
    The key property is called one-to-one. A function is one-to-one when
    different inputs always produce different outputs. No two distinct x-values
    ever land on the same y-value. There is an equivalent way to say this: if
    you know that f of x one equals f of x two, then you can conclude that x
    one must equal x two. Both statements capture the same idea, but the second
    form is often easier to use in a proof.
  timing:
    lead_in_seconds: 0.2
    hold_after_seconds: 0.6
    minimum_duration_seconds: 5.0
  data:
    statement: "A function \\(f\\) is one-to-one if different inputs always produce different outputs."
    math_lines:
      - "\\[f(x_1) \\ne f(x_2) \\qquad \\text{whenever } x_1 \\ne x_2.\\]"
      - text: "\\[f(x_1) = f(x_2) \\;\\Longrightarrow\\; x_1 = x_2.\\]"
        animation: "highlight"
~~~

**What the rewrite does:**

- The book's two equivalent symbolic forms become two `math_lines` in the same order. The second form (the one the book calls "often easier to use in a proof") is flagged `animation: "highlight"` so it visibly flashes as the payoff.
- The book's hedging verb ("We say that `f` is one-to-one if ...") is stripped from `statement`. The statement on screen is a single declarative sentence; the teacherly register returns in the voiceover.
- `\emph{...}` and `\index{...}` are dropped -- they have no video analog.
- The voiceover does not read the math aloud symbol-by-symbol. `f(x_1) \ne f(x_2)` becomes "f of x one is different from f of x two" in spoken form, and the voiceover paraphrases that at "no two distinct x-values ever land on the same y-value" for variety.
- The voiceover does not say the title, does not reference a definition number, and does not open with "In this scene".
- `content_type: "definition"` is explicit so `definition_math` renders with the cyan accent -- this satisfies the MUST on `content_type` for `definition_math` scenes.
- `scene_exit: "hold"` keeps the final frame visible while the TTS finishes the five-sentence narration.

---

## What to Include vs Skip

### Always include

- Every `\begin{definition}`.
- Every `\begin{theorem}` and `\begin{proposition}`.
- Every `\begin{example}` -- manuscript examples are the primary teaching currency.
- Any procedure or algorithm that the book explicitly numbers.
- Any figure whose geometric content is part of the learning.

### Conditionally include

- `\begin{proof}` -- include when the argument is short, pedagogically instructive, or when the manuscript already includes it. Skip when the proof is either trivial or so technical that watching it animate provides less than reading it.
- `\begin{remark}` -- include as its own scene when the remark names a rule or flags a pitfall students often miss; otherwise fold into voiceover of the neighboring scene.
- `\begin{figure}` conceptual diagrams -- include when the diagram teaches something the prose alone cannot. Skip when the diagram is only a decorative restatement of the prose.

### Always skip

- `\begin{exercise}` and `\subsection*{Exercises}` blocks **MUST NOT** appear in any scene. They are for student self-practice on the book only; they never enter the video. See the Media scope note in [`README.md`](README.md).
- Index commands (`\index{...}`) -- no video analog.
- Cross-references (`\cref{...}`) to objects outside the current section -- paraphrase the referenced result rather than pointing to it; the student watching a video has no page to flip to.
- Chapter overview paragraphs that are already incorporated into the opening hook.

### Section summary at the end

If the book has a `\section*{Summary}`, use it as raw material for the `recap_cards` scene. If the book does not, still write a recap -- every video closes with one.

---

## Voiceover: Writing for Speech

This is the layer where authoring most often goes wrong. Book prose reads well on a page and sounds stilted when spoken. Rewrite every narration line for the ear.

### Voice and register

- **"We" for the class, imperative for setup, "you" sparingly and only for direct call-outs.** Book: "We obtain `x = ...`." Video: same, or "We obtain x equals ..." when the math is read aloud. Avoid "the reader" and "I".
- **Contractions are usually open.** Prefer "let us", "that is", "do not" over "let's", "i.e.", "don't". The Sec. 1.1 storyboard is consistent on this. Exception: when a contraction genuinely improves flow, it is allowed.
- **Classroom filler is OK in small doses.** Phrases like "Here is the idea", "Notice that", "The lesson:", "Watch what happens", "Now look at" pull the student along. Do not overuse them.
- **Forbidden in voiceover**: section numbers, equation labels, "as we will see in Chapter 3", LaTeX command names, and the words "above", "below", "on the left of this page". The video has no page.

### Spoken math

Math symbols must be rewritten as speech. Do **not** let the TTS pronounce `f(x_1)` as "f paren x sub 1 close paren".

| Written | Spoken in voiceover |
|---|---|
| `f(x)` | "f of x" |
| `f(x_1)` | "f of x one" (not "x sub one") |
| `f^{-1}` | "f inverse" |
| `f^{-1}(y)` | "f inverse of y" |
| `x \ne y` | "x is different from y" or "x does not equal y" |
| `x_1 \ne x_2 \Rightarrow f(x_1) \ne f(x_2)` | "if x one is different from x two, then f of x one is different from f of x two" |
| `\sqrt{x}` | "the square root of x" |
| `\sqrt[3]{x-2}` | "the cube root of x minus two" |
| `x \in A` | "x in A" or "x belongs to A" |
| `y \in B` | "y in B" |
| `\frac{1}{4}` | "one fourth" (or "one over four" if disambiguation needed) |
| `x^2` | "x squared" |
| `x^3` | "x cubed" |
| `x^n` | "x to the n" |
| `\le`, `\ge` | "less than or equal to", "greater than or equal to" |
| `[-1, 1]` | "minus one to one" or "the interval minus one to one" |
| `\Leftrightarrow` | "if and only if" |
| `\lim_{x \to a} f(x)` | "the limit of f of x as x approaches a" |
| `f'(x)` | "f prime of x" |
| `\sin^{-1}(x)` | "inverse sine of x" (or "arc sine of x", follow CONTENT_SPEC.md) |

Numbers: write "minus one half", not "negative one-half", to match how the Sec. 1.1 narration reads.

### Per-scene structure

A voiceover block should have three parts in this order, not necessarily all present:

1. **Hook or transition** -- 1 sentence connecting to what just happened or stating what this scene is about. "Now let us test two mathematical functions." "Here is the definition."
2. **Body** -- 2-4 sentences carrying the content. This is where the math is spoken and the logic is walked.
3. **Takeaway or bridge** -- 1 sentence summarizing what the student should remember, or pointing to the next scene. "The lesson: ask whether a single output can be traced back to two different inputs."

Three to six sentences is the target range for standard content scenes (`definition_math`, `graph_focus`, ordinary `example_walkthrough`, `procedure_steps`, `recap_cards`). Two carve-outs:

- **`section_transition` scenes** SHOULD be 1-2 sentences. They are brief interludes; a 3-sentence transition stops feeling like relief and starts feeling like content.
- **`example_walkthrough` scenes that bundle a procedure plus its verification, or that enumerate 4+ distinct algebraic moves,** MAY run up to 9 sentences. The scene still holds one teaching idea ("apply the procedure and verify the answer" is one idea, not two), so splitting would harm cohesion more than length helps it.

Outside those carve-outs, longer than six sentences and the scene probably needs splitting; shorter than three and the visual is probably doing work the narration should reinforce.

### What voiceover and `data` should share

- `data` is what appears on screen: the statement, the math_lines, the bullets, the steps.
- `voiceover` is what is said over the screen.
- They should cover the same material but **not word-for-word**. Book `data.statement`: "A function `f` is one-to-one if different inputs always produce different outputs." Voiceover: "The key property is called one-to-one. A function is one-to-one when different inputs always produce different outputs. No two distinct x-values ever land on the same y-value."

Rule of thumb: `data` is terse and symbolic, voiceover is expanded and narrative. If the TTS reads the narration while the statement is on screen, both layers should reinforce the same idea without sounding like a teleprompter.

**Example of good separation:**
```yaml
title: "One-to-One Functions"
voiceover: >
  The key property is called one-to-one. A function is one-to-one when different 
  inputs always produce different outputs. No two distinct x-values ever land 
  on the same y-value.
data:
  statement: |
    A function is one-to-one if different inputs always produce different outputs.
  math_lines:
    - "x_1 \\ne x_2 \\implies f(x_1) \\ne f(x_2)"
```

### Things the voiceover MUST NOT do

- **MUST NOT** say the scene title. The title is already on screen.
- **MUST NOT** enumerate on-screen bullets verbatim. Paraphrase or elaborate.
- **MUST NOT** reference equation numbers, figure numbers, section numbers, or any `\cref{...}` target from the book.
- **MUST NOT** use "see", "refer to", "as shown", "in the diagram below / above".
- **MUST NOT** open with "In this scene we will...". Just start teaching.

### Voiceover SHOULD guidelines

- Voiceover length **SHOULD** land in the 3-to-6-sentence range for standard content scenes. `section_transition` scenes **SHOULD** be 1-2 sentences; `example_walkthrough` scenes that bundle procedure plus verification **MAY** run up to 9 sentences. The underlying target is cohesion (one teaching idea per scene), not a hard sentence count.
- Math symbols **MUST** be rewritten as spoken English (see the table above). TTS mispronunciation of raw LaTeX is a hard failure.
- The opening sentence of each voiceover **SHOULD** be a hook or transition, and the closing sentence **SHOULD** be a takeaway or bridge.

---

## `data`: What Goes on Screen

Each template has required `data` fields; the rules below are additional shaping.

### `definition_math` / theorem / proposition statements

- `statement`: one English sentence, terse, no narrative padding. The statement earns its place on screen.
- `math_lines`: the formal symbolic content. Use the extended-dict form (`text:` + `animation:`) to draw the eye to the key line. `highlight` on the final clinching form of an if-and-only-if is a common pattern.
- `supporting_bullets`: optional short consequences (e.g., domain-and-range corollaries).

Do not repeat the `statement` inside `math_lines`. If the statement is a formula, put it in `math_lines` and use the English version for `statement`.

### `example_walkthrough`

- `steps`: 3-5 short strings, one per logical move. These appear as text steps that build in sequence.
- `math_lines`: the symbolic scratch-work. Use `math_layout: "equals_aligned"` when the derivation is a chain of equations that shares an `=` anchor (it almost always does for solve-for-x problems).
- Use `animation: "transform_from_previous"` between math lines that evolve from each other (e.g., `y = x^3 + 2` -> `x = \sqrt[3]{y-2}`). Use `highlight` on the final line.
- `takeaway`: one sentence. This is where "always verify the cancellation equation" or "a single counterexample is enough" belongs.
- `data.decay_previous` (opt, default `true`) controls whether earlier `math_lines` fade to low opacity as later ones are introduced. **SHOULD** set to `false` whenever any `voiceover` sentence verbally refers back to an earlier `math_line` or `step` in the same scene (for example, a verification pass that re-reads an earlier result, or a procedure + verification bundle where the verification line plugs a prior expression back in). If the narration calls back to a line that has already dimmed, the scene and the voiceover desynchronize.

#### Worked example: example + solution -> `example_walkthrough` scene

This illustrates the typical `example` + `solution` -> `example_walkthrough` mapping, including `equals_aligned` layout and the interplay of `transform_from_previous` and `highlight`.

**LaTeX source** (`chapters/ch01_foundations.tex`, Sec. 1.1.3):

~~~latex
\begin{example}
Find the inverse of
\(
f(x)=x^3+2.
\)
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
Let
\[
y=x^3+2.
\]
Then
\[
x^3=y-2,
\]
so
\[
x=\sqrt[3]{\,y-2\,}.
\]
Interchanging \(x\) and \(y\), we obtain
\[
f^{-1}(x)=\sqrt[3]{\,x-2\,}.
\]
We check this by composition:
\[
f\bigl(f^{-1}(x)\bigr)
= \left(\sqrt[3]{\,x-2\,}\right)^3+2
= x-2+2
= x.
\]
Thus the inverse is correct.
\end{solution}

    minus two. Step three: interchange x and y. So f inverse of x equals the
    cube root of x minus two. Finally, let us verify. Compute f of f inverse
    of x: plug the cube root of x minus two into x cubed plus two. The cube
    and the cube root cancel, giving x minus two plus two, which is x. The

**What the rewrite does:**

- The book's four displayed equations (`y=x^3+2`, `x^3=y-2`, `x=\sqrt[3]{y-2}`, `f^{-1}(x)=\sqrt[3]{x-2}`) collapse to three `math_lines`. The intermediate `x^3 = y-2` is absorbed into the voiceover as a spoken step rather than an on-screen frame -- it does not mark a distinct stage worth its own animation beat. This is a SHOULD: when two adjacent equations are one algebraic move apart, the earlier one **MAY** be elided from `math_lines` if the voiceover carries it.
- `math_layout: "equals_aligned"` pins the `=` sign across all three lines so the derivation reads as a coherent chain rather than three separate formulas.
- `animation: "transform_from_previous"` on the middle line makes the first equation visibly morph into the solved form.
- `animation: "highlight"` on the final line flashes `f^{-1}(x) = \sqrt[3]{x-2}` as the answer. One `highlight` per scene is the SHOULD; two dilutes the signal.
- The verification step lives in `steps` (with a trailing `\\checkmark`), not in `math_lines`. The reason is that verification is bookkeeping rather than derivation, and the voiceover carries its logic adequately. Putting it in `math_lines` would force a fourth `equals_aligned` frame that pedagogically reads as part of the derivation, which it is not.
- `takeaway` is added even though the book has no explicit takeaway sentence. Every `example_walkthrough` scene **SHOULD** carry a one-sentence takeaway; it is the part of the example a student should write down.
- `minimum_duration_seconds: 7.0` is higher than the default 5.0 because the voiceover is long (two teaching beats: procedure and verification).
- The voiceover rewrites the book's displayed `\bigl(f^{-1}(x)\bigr)` composition into spoken form ("f of f inverse of x") and narrates the cancellation step-by-step rather than presenting it as a finished equation chain.

### `graph_focus`

- Stay inside the expression-helper vocabulary: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `sqrt`, `exp`, `log`, `cbrt`, `abs`, `pi`, `e`. `graph_focus` expressions **MUST** use `cbrt(...)` for cube roots and **MUST NOT** use `**(1/3)`; the latter produces complex numbers on negative bases and breaks Manim's plotter. ([MANIM_REFERENCE.md:220-233](MANIM_REFERENCE.md#L220-L233))
- Set `x_range` on a plot to the restricted domain if you are illustrating a restriction; do not rely on axis clipping.
- Use `label_side` and `label_x` when two curves are close together or a label might overlap the `y = x` line. Preview with `manim_preview_graph_focus.py` to verify.
- Keep `annotations` to one short sentence each, 6.5 units wide at most.
- For the Midnight Canvas color assignment: primary curve cool cyan `#4cc9f0`, inverse/contrast curve warm gold `#f9a825`, `y = x` reflection line faded grey `#c8c8d8` dashed, counterexample lines coral `#ff6b6b` dashed, highlighted points gold.

### `procedure_steps`

- `steps`: imperative sentences in order. One verb each: "Write", "Solve", "Interchange".
- `worked_equations`: a schematic of what the procedure produces, typically a single line with `\cdots` placeholders showing the shape.

### `recap_cards`

- `points`: 4-6 bullets. Each is a one-sentence crystallization of one scene's lesson. These are not a list of topics covered; they are the takeaways.
- `identities`: 1-3 canonical formulas worth memorizing from this video.

## Figures: Redrawing the Book in Manim

### Principle

Book figures are authoritative for **what** to show, not **how** to show it. Redraw, do not reproduce.

The book uses TikZ / pgfplots on a light background. The video uses Manim on the Midnight Canvas dark background. Colors, stroke weights, and labeling conventions all differ. A faithful reproduction of the book figure would look wrong in the video design system.

### Workflow

1. **Read the book figure.** Identify the mathematical objects (axes range, function expression, domain, key points, annotations) and the pedagogical purpose (what the student is supposed to notice).
2. **Pick the template.** Function graph -> `graph_focus`. Mapping diagram, interval, arrows -> `graph_focus` with a custom `hook`, or consider the `comparison` template if the figure is genuinely two parallel ideas.
3. **Re-express in Manim terms.** Convert TikZ coordinates to `axes.x_range` / `y_range` and plot `expression`s. Drop decorative TikZ styling (custom arrow tips, colored fills, background grids); the Midnight Canvas defaults handle the visual language.
4. **Animate, do not just display.** A static book figure is a single page; a Manim scene can have the curve trace out with `Create`, the horizontal test line sweep in, and the intersection points flash. Make the motion carry a teaching moment.

### When to use a custom `hook`

Templates cover the common shapes. Reach for a custom hook (an import path under `tools/manim_hooks/`) when:

- The figure is a side-by-side comparison of two graphs with specific coordinated animations (e.g., horizontal line test: "works on the left, fails on the right" with synchronized line sweeps). See `horizontal_line_test_figure` in the Sec. 1.1 storyboard.
- The figure is a mapping diagram with arrows, labels, and bent connectors that no template templates.
- The figure requires composition of multiple graph transforms whose timing needs to be hand-controlled.

Do **not** reach for a hook to avoid learning the template. Most figure jobs fit `graph_focus` with a thoughtful `plots` list.

### When to skip a book figure entirely

If the book figure is a conceptual diagram whose content is already animated inside another scene's `data.math_lines` or `data.steps`, the figure can be skipped. Example: the Sec. 1.1 inverse-composition mapping diagram (`fig:inverse-composition`) is not a separate Manim scene -- its content is already carried by the `composition_identities` scene's math and the `cubic_graph_reflection` scene's geometry. Skipping is legitimate; silently replacing is not. Document the skip in a YAML comment above the neighboring scene so a later editor knows it was deliberate.

### Add Manim visualizations that are not in the book

Far more important than redrawing book figures is adding video-native visualizations where the book only uses prose. The Sec. 1.1 storyboard does this three times:

- `why_x_squared_fails` -- book states in one sentence ("the value 1/4 comes from both 1/2 and -1/2"); video gives it a whole graph scene.
- `cubic_graph_reflection` -- book states reflection across `y = x` in prose; video shows the two curves and the mirror line.
- `restricted_parabola_graph` -- same reflection idea applied to `x^2` and `\sqrt{x}`.

Any prose claim about "the graph is a reflection", "the curve crosses here", "one function is shifted", "domain restriction changes the shape" is a candidate for its own `graph_focus` scene.

---

## Titles and Scene IDs

### `scene_id`

- snake_case, short, descriptive of the teaching idea not the book structure.
- Good: `one_to_one_definition`, `why_x_squared_fails`, `cubic_graph_reflection`, `existence_theorem`.
- Bad: `scene_3`, `def_1_1_1`, `subsection_1`, `fig_1_1`.
- Must be unique within the storyboard; used as cache keys by the renderer.

### `title` (on-screen scene title)

- Sentence- or Title-case English that a student could read as a standalone thought.
- Use `$...$` for math symbols in titles: `"Why $x^2$ Cannot Be Inverted"`, `"Graphs of $f$ and $f^{-1}$"`. Rendered inside `\textbf{}` -- math stays in math weight, surrounding text is bold.
- Never use the book's section or subsection heading verbatim. The Sec. 1.1 book has `\subsection{One-to-one functions}`; the video opens with `"Inverse Functions"` and the one-to-one scene is titled `"One-to-One Functions"` -- similar but adjusted for standalone reading.
- Descriptive > structural. Prefer `"How to Find an Inverse"` over `"Section 1.1.3"`.
- A little flavor is acceptable for added scenes -- `"A Concrete Example"`, `"Testing with Algebra"`, `"Key Takeaways"`. Do not force it.

---

## Timing and Scene Exits

### `scene_exit`

A scene **SHOULD** use `scene_exit: "hold"`. The voiceover is almost always longer than the animation, and `hold` keeps the final frame visible while the TTS finishes. `scene_exit: "fade"` is appropriate only for genuinely brief `section_transition` scenes. A storyboard **SHOULD NOT** use `scene_exit: "none"` without a specific reason recorded in a YAML comment.

### `timing`

Three fields, all in seconds:

- `lead_in_seconds`: `0.2-0.3`. Small breathing room before animations begin.
- `hold_after_seconds`: `0.4-1.0`. How long the final frame lingers after the last animation. Use higher values (`0.8-1.0`) for graph scenes and the recap, so the student can absorb. Use lower values (`0.4`) for transitions.
- `minimum_duration_seconds`: a floor, not a cap. Use `3.0` for transitions, `5.0-6.0` for standard content scenes, `7.0` for theorem_proof with multi-step proofs or long example walkthroughs.

The renderer caches scenes on the **visual payload** (template, title, data, theme, hook). Changing `voiceover` or `timing` does **not** force a re-render -- narration-only edits are cheap. Use this to iterate on the spoken script without paying the Manim cost.

---

## `content_type`: Accent Color Disambiguation

The `content_type` field sets the scene's accent color per the Midnight Canvas content-type map. Most templates infer a reasonable default, but the following patterns are worth making explicit:

| Scene flavor | `content_type` | Accent role |
|---|---|---|
| Formal definition | `definition` | cool cyan (`secondary`) |
| Main theorem / key result | `theorem` | warm gold (`accent`) |
| Secondary formal statement | `proposition` | cool cyan |
| Worked example | `example` | yellow highlight |
| Counterexample, pitfall, failure mode | `warning` | coral red |
| Numbered procedure | `procedure` | neutral |
| Closing summary | `recap` | neutral gathered |

`content_type` **MUST** be set explicitly on every `definition_math` scene, because that template carries definitions, theorems, and propositions and the renderer cannot infer which one from the template alone.

Set `warning` for counterexample scenes like `why_x_squared_fails`. This is how the "watch out, this is where the failure is" moment gets its coral accent.

---

## Ordering Heuristics

The scene order is not just the order things appear in the book. Rearrange freely for pedagogy.

Preferred flow for a single section:

1. **Open.** `title_bullets` with 2-3 bullets that preview the question of the video.
2. **Motivation / first concept.** The definition that opens the section, spoken plainly before formalism.
3. **Concrete example of the new concept.** If the book has a real-world or numerical example, put it before the algebraic example. Students attach the definition to the concrete case first.
4. **Algebraic example.** Symbolic treatment of the same idea.
5. **Visual/graphical support** if prose makes a geometric claim.
6. **Supporting proposition / lemma** if stated in the book.
7. **Section transition** if the section has distinct subsections.
8. **Next concept -- repeat 2-6 as needed.**
9. **Procedure** if the section codifies an algorithm.
10. **Worked example applying the procedure.**
11. **Any reflection / symmetry / graphical visualization of the worked example.**
12. **Domain-restriction / edge-case example** if the book has one.
13. **Graphical support for the edge case.**
14. **Recap.** 4-6 takeaway points + 1-2 canonical identities.

The Sec. 1.1 storyboard follows this flow closely; compare scene by scene if uncertain.

## Hooks

A `hook` is a dotted Python path to a custom animation function (e.g., `tools.manim_hooks.ch01_inverse_functions.horizontal_line_test_comparison`). It overrides the default template rendering for that scene.

### When to use a hook

- The scene needs a layout no template provides (two small graphs side by side with coordinated line sweeps).
- The scene needs an animation sequence that cannot be expressed via `math_lines` animation hints alone.
- The scene reuses a non-trivial motion that will appear in multiple chapters (define it once in a hooks module, reuse).

### When not to use a hook

- The scene is a mild variation on `definition_math` or `example_walkthrough`. Stick with the template; use `animation: "highlight"` and `math_layout: "equals_aligned"` to get what you need.
- The scene's visual would fit `graph_focus` with the right `plots` list. Every added `graph_focus` scene in Sec. 1.1 is hook-free except the one that genuinely needs side-by-side panels.
- You have not tried the template yet. Templates are richer than they look; read the template catalog before writing a hook.

### Where to put hooks

- Chapter-scoped: `tools/manim_hooks/ch<NN>_<topic>.py`. The Sec. 1.1 hooks live in `tools/manim_hooks/ch01_inverse_functions.py`.
- Cross-chapter motion primitives: `tools/manim_templates/animations.py` (but only if the primitive is genuinely template-level).

## Pre-render Checklist

Before running `manim_render_lesson.py`:

### Content
- [ ] Every `\begin{definition}`, `\begin{theorem}`, `\begin{proposition}`, and `\begin{example}` in the source section is covered by a scene.
- [ ] No `\begin{exercise}` content leaked into the storyboard.
- [ ] Opening hook and closing recap are present.
- [ ] Every prose claim about graph shape, reflection, or geometric behavior has a visualization scene (or a deliberate skip noted in a comment).

### Voiceover
- [ ] Every `voiceover` is 3-6 sentences for standard content scenes; 1-2 for `section_transition`; up to 9 for `example_walkthrough` with bundled verification.
- [ ] No voiceover references section numbers, figure numbers, equation labels, or "see above/below".
- [ ] Math symbols are written as spoken English (`f of x one`, not `f(x_1)`).
- [ ] Opening sentence of every voiceover is a hook or transition, not "In this scene...".
- [ ] Closing sentence is a takeaway or bridge.

### Data
- [ ] Every `definition_math` scene has both `statement` (English) and `math_lines` (symbolic).
- [ ] `example_walkthrough` scenes use `equals_aligned` when the algebra shares an `=` anchor.
- [ ] `example_walkthrough` scenes whose voiceover calls back to an earlier `math_line` or `step` set `data.decay_previous: false`.
- [ ] `transform_from_previous` is used between evolving equations, `highlight` on the final line.
- [ ] Every `graph_focus` plot has its `x_range` set to the restricted domain if relevant, and `label_side` / `label_x` set when labels could overlap.
- [ ] `cbrt(...)` is used for cube roots, not `**(1/3)`.
- [ ] Every graph scene has been previewed with `manim_preview_graph_focus.py`.

### Metadata
- [ ] `content_type` is explicit on every `definition_math` scene.
- [ ] `scene_exit: "hold"` is set everywhere except short transitions.
- [ ] `timing.hold_after_seconds` is `0.8-1.0` on graph scenes and the recap.
- [ ] Every `scene_id` is unique, snake_case, and descriptive.
- [ ] Every `title` reads as a standalone thought.

### Sanity
- [ ] Export `narration.md` and read the entire thing end to end. If any paragraph sounds like a textbook, rewrite it.
- [ ] Estimate total duration: (sum of `minimum_duration_seconds`) x 1.5 is a rough lower bound. A one-section video in the 6-10 minute range is healthy.

## Maintenance: When the Handout Changes

When `chapters/*.tex` changes in a way that affects a section already storyboarded:

1. **Diff the section.** Identify which formal environments were added, removed, or rewritten.
2. **Update the relevant scenes.** A renamed variable, a rewritten example, or a new definition each requires surgical edits -- not a full storyboard rewrite.
3. **Re-check voiceover for consistency.** If the handout's notation changed, voiceovers that reference that notation must be updated too.
4. **Re-preview changed graph scenes** before rendering.
5. **Do not regenerate the storyboard from the deck JSON.** The storyboard is the source of truth; regeneration would lose all manual authoring.

If the handout changes are large (an entire subsection rewritten), a partial rewrite of the storyboard is appropriate. In that case, keep the old file as `<deck_id>_vN.yml.bak` temporarily, but delete the backup once the new version is rendered and accepted.

## Changelog

- **v1.3** -- added a SHOULD rule for `example_walkthrough` `data.decay_previous`: scenes whose voiceover calls back to an earlier `math_line` or `step` should set it to `false`. Added a matching pre-render checklist item. Motivated by the Sec. 1.1 v2 preview render, where `example_walkthrough` scenes with default `decay_previous: true` dimmed earlier lines before the TTS narration reached its verbal reference to them.
- **v1.2** -- refined the voiceover sentence-count SHOULD based on audit findings from the Sec. 1.1 v2 rewrite. The 3-to-6-sentence target was being violated in 10 of 19 scenes, but on review the violations were not defects: `section_transition` scenes are naturally 1-2 sentences (they are interludes), and `example_walkthrough` scenes that bundle procedure plus verification are naturally 7-9 sentences (one cohesive teaching idea, not two). Two carve-outs now written into the rule and into the pre-render checklist. No other rules weakened.
- **v1.1** -- added a Conformance Keywords section (MUST / SHOULD / MAY) and rewrote load-bearing rules (scene decomposition, exercise exclusion, voiceover must-nots, `cbrt` usage, `content_type` on `definition_math`, `scene_exit` default) to use the new keywords. Added two worked before/after examples: Sec. 1.1.1 one-to-one definition (definition -> `definition_math`) and Sec. 1.1.3 cubic inverse example (example + solution -> `example_walkthrough`). Softened the single-exemplar framing so Sec. 1.1 is a reference calibration point rather than a tiebreaker. Replaced em-dash, en-dash, arrow, section-sign, and multiplication-sign in body text with ASCII equivalents so the file reads cleanly in terminals that degrade non-ASCII to `?`. Paired with cross-doc updates to `README.md`, `MANIM_REFERENCE.md`, and `MANIM_CHECKLIST.md` that unify "direct from LaTeX" as the recommended workflow and demote seeding to a legacy bootstrap path.
- **v1.0** -- initial guide. Derived from reverse-engineering the Sec. 1.1 *Inverse Functions* storyboard against `chapters/ch01_foundations.tex`. Covered scope, scene decomposition, environment->template mapping, voiceover rewriting, `data` shaping, figure handling, titles, timing, `content_type`, ordering heuristics, hook usage, a pre-render checklist, and handout-change maintenance.
